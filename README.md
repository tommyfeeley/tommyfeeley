- 👋 Hi, I’m Tommy Feeley. 3rd year computer science student at Rutgers, transferring from community college in 2021.
- 👀 I’m interested in bot development/automation/antibot. I know Java and I'm competent with Python but definitely need to refresh myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning golang, rust.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any botting software I can learn from, not looking for money at the moment just want to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me Twitter @TommyFeeley, discord tommÿ#1443
